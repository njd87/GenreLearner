# WHAT IS THE PROJECT
This was a machine learning model I developed to predict the genre of songs using spectogram analysis. It's main purpose is to be in music therapy for music assignment to patients.

# IMPORANT NOTE
This project is VERY unorganized as of this commit. Documentation needs to be added to each file, instructions must be given, AND directories need to be made general. Feel free to browse the files, but an update is coming to organize everything.
